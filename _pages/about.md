Psych-AD: Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer’s Disease

Understanding the molecular mechanisms of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease and Alzheimer's disease related dementias

The Psych-AD program is a constellation of projects aiming to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Alzheimer's disease Related Dementias (ADRD) by integrating epidemiologic, multi-omic and mechanistic research through the application of systems and network biology approaches. The goal of the program is to discover and characterize new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for the treatment of NPS in AD and ADRD. The projects that are part of the Psych-AD program are supported by the National Institute on Aging through the funding initiatives: PAR-18-596 (Notice NOT-AG-18-001 Topic #9 , Data-Driven Approaches to Understand the Molecular Mechanisms of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms in Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementia) and RFA-MH-19-510, Novel Mechanism Research on Neuropsychiatric Symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's Dementia Notice NOT-AG-18-029).
