Neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases impose a significant societal and public health burden. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying these highly complex conditions remains limited. To gain deeper insights into the etiology of different brain diseases, we used specimens from 1,494 unique donors to generate a population-scale single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), comprising over 6.3 million individual nuclei. The cohort includes neurotypical controls as well as donors affected by eight common and complex brain disorders: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinson’s disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We show that inter-individual variation accounts for a substantial portion of gene expression variation in the DLPFC. By comparing transcriptomic variation across diseases, we reveal universal signatures enriched in basic cellular functions such as mRNA splicing and protein localization. After discounting these cross-disease signatures, we show strong genetic and transcriptomic concordance among AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD, largely driven by alteration of synaptic signaling functions in neurons. Furthermore, we characterize transcriptomic variation among different AD phenotypes that were distinct from healthy aging. We uncover mitigating effects of interneurons and aggravating effects of immune and vascular cells in AD dementia. Further exploring the effect of the neuropsychiatric symptoms frequently accompanying AD, we identify a link to deep layer excitatory neurons. By constructing transcriptome trajectories that capture AD progression, we show cell-type specific responses implicated in early and late stages of AD. Our atlas provides an unprecedented perspective of the transcriptomic landscape in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, shedding light on shared and distinct processes involving the neuro-immune-vascular systems, and identifying potential targets for therapeutic intervention.

![Aging](/assets/images/PsychAD_Aging.png)

The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is central to higher cognitive functions and is particularly vulnerable to age-related decline. To advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying brain development, maturation, and aging, we constructed a detailed single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, encompassing over 1.3 million nuclei from 284 postmortem samples spanning the full human lifespan (0-97 years). This atlas reveals distinct phases of transcriptomic activity: a dynamic developmental period, stabilization during midlife, and subtle yet coordinated changes in late adulthood. Modeling non-linear age trends across the lifespan shows ten distinct trajectories of the entire transcriptome from all cell types, with notable findings in neurons and microglia, linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and Alzheimer’s disease risk, respectively. Moreover, excitatory neurons exhibit a convergence of gene expression patterns across the lifespan, suggesting the emergence of a common molecular signature of aging. Pseudotime analysis tracing the progression of cellular lineages throughout life reveals key gene clusters with dynamic expression changes that reflect development, maturation, and aging, as well as their connection to brain-related diseases. We uncover significant circadian rhythm reprogramming in late adulthood, characterized by disruption of core clock gene rhythmicity and the emergence of new rhythmic patterns, particularly within microglia and oligodendrocytes. This comprehensive single-cell atlas provides a baseline for understanding the molecular transitions from development through successful aging in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.
