**Goal of the Project**

  The PsychAD Consortium seeks to deepen our understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), related dementias (ADRD), and serious mental illnesses (SMIs) by exploring shared and distinct biological pathways underlying these disorders. By combining epidemiological data with advanced multi-omic and systems biology approaches, PsychAD aims to uncover biomarkers and therapeutic targets that can improve diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of NPS. Using a large autopsy dataset, the consortium builds high-resolution, single-cell models to examine gene expression across genetic, developmental, and disease-related dimensions. These models reveal cell-specific pathways that influence NPS and disease progression, offering valuable insights for precision medicine. Ultimately, PsychAD strives to create a foundational framework for targeted, cross-disorder treatments that address the molecular complexity of AD, ADRD, and SMIs.

**About NIA's Psych-AD program**

The Psych-AD program brings together projects focused on uncovering the molecular mechanisms behind neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related dementias (ADRD). By combining epidemiologic, multi-omic, and mechanistic research through systems biology, Psych-AD aims to identify new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for NPS in AD/ADRD. The program is supported by the National Institute on Aging via funding from [PAR-23-207](https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/pa-files/PAR-23-207.html) and RFA-MH-19-510.
